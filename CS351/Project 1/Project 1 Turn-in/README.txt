        * The files with the prefix "knapRun" are the output of the greedy algorithm
        
        * The files with the prefix "greedyTest" contain the data to be read in

        * The numbers in the files names signify the number of items being tested

        * To run the makefile, simply be in the correct file path and use the command "makefile -f makefile.greedy", then execute with "greedy.exe"

        * To run the test builder, use the command "g++ greedyTestBuilder.cpp", then "./a.out", then follow the program's directions.
