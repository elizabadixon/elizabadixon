        * The files with the prefix "knapRun" are the output of the refined dynamic algorithm
        
        * The files with the prefix "dynamicTest" contain the data to be read in

        * The numbers in the files names signify the number of items being tested

        * To run the test builder, use the command "g++ dynamTestBuild.cpp", then "./a.out", then follow the program's directions.
