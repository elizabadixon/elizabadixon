PROJECT 3 DIRECTIONS:

        * The files with the prefix "knapRun" are the output values of the backtracking algorithm
        
        * The files with the prefix "backTest" contain the sample values to be read in

        * The numbers in the file names signify the number of items being tested

        * To run the makefile, simply be in the correct file path and use the command "makefile -f makefile.backtrack", then execute with "back.exe"

        * To run the test builder, use the command "g++ backTestBuild.cpp" to compile it, then "./a.out" to run it, then follow the program's directions
