The "elizabadixon" repository includes the projects I have completed as part of my coursework as a Software Engineering student at Butler University:

For Advanced Data Structures course using C++:
  1) Indy500 Race Simulation (Intro to C++ classes).
  2) Shuffling within a card game simulation (Class Hierarchy, pointers, basic game logic/backend UI w/ pointers).
  3) Bit Display (Work with bit vectors, bit arrays, bit dictionaries, lookup tables).
  4) Doubly Linked List Traversal/Insertion.
  5) Red-Black Tree (insertions, rotations, traversal simulations, general red-black tree/binary tree rule implementation).
  6) Hash Table/Collision Technique Implementation (Chaining - includes removal of nodes in a linked list, cuckoo hashing, and linear/quadratic probing techniques).

For Computer Networks using C/C++:
  1) Basic socket object and connection connection.
  2) HTTP Message Object used to make an HTTP request.
  3) SMTP Mailer Agent that simulates an email being sent
  4) IP Calculator that accepts a CIDR format and displays the Network, Broadcast, and # of usable addresses.

For Intro to Software Engineering using C#/.NET on Visual Studio:
  1) Semester-long insurance claim database team project
  2) Carried out using the Agile/Scrum methodology
  3) Apart from the piece of software itself, the directory includes the sprint reviews and final report for the project

IN PROGRESS:

  EPICS (Engineering Projects in Community Service):
    1) Deliverable is a comprehensive tutorial that will assist medical professionals in using a particular software meant to safely store patient data in offline/online environments 

  SE463 - Software Testing & Quality Assurance:
    1) After learning about various software testing techniques, students put them into action and write reports about them
    2) I have completed Boundary Value Analysis, Equivalence Class Testing, and Path-based Testing
    
  CS351 - Algorithms:
    1) Apart from learning about various methods of algorithm optimization, students are tasked with writing programs using the 0-1 Knapsack Problem - altered using various techniques
    2) I have completed the Greedy version
