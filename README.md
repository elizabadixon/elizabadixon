The "elizabadixon" repository includes the projects I have completed as part of my coursework as a Software Engineering student at Butler University:

For Advanced Data Structures course using C++:
  1) Indy500 Race Simulation (Intro to C++ classes).
  2) Shuffling within a card game simulation (Class Hierarchy, pointers, basic game logic/backend UI w/ pointers).
  3) Bit Display (Work with bit vectors, bit arrays, bit dictionaries, lookup tables).
  4) Doubly Linked List Traversal/Insertion.
  5) Red-Black Tree (insertions, rotations, traversal simulations, general red-black tree/binary tree rule implementation).
  6) Hash Table/Collision Technique Implementation (Chaining - includes removal of nodes in a linked list, cuckoo hashing, and linear/quadratic probing techniques).

For Computer Networks using C/C++:
  1) Basic socket object and connection connection.
  2) HTTP Message Object used to make an HTTP request.
  3) SMTP Mailer Agent that simulates an email being sent.
  4) IP Calculator that accepts a CIDR format and displays the Network, Broadcast, and # of usable addresses.

For Intro to Software Engineering using C#/.NET on Visual Studio:
  1) Semester-long insurance claim database team project.
  2) Carried out using the Agile/Scrum methodology.
  3) Apart from the piece of software itself, the directory includes the sprint reviews and final report for the project.

SE463 - Software Testing & Quality Assurance:
  1) After learning about various software testing techniques, students put them into action and write reports about them. A1 is about basic Boundary Value Analysis.
  2) A2 focuses on the types of Equivalence Class Testing like Weak-Normal, Weak-Robust, and Strong-Robust with the addition of Decision Table Testing in the context of a program that sorts a list of numbers based on common sorting techniques like Insertion Sort and Bubble Sort.
  3)  A3 immersed students in Data Flow Testing - using data flow charting techniques to visualize a testing problem in order to make repetitive testing processes easier to organize.
  4)   A4 honed in on Slice Testing techniques by hand (although usually automated by tools such as JUnit) in order to help students understand one of the many testing techniques that help eliminate unnecessary lines of code to test in certain scenarios. I created a basic slice testing tracker program for this project.
  5) A5 focused on Bottom-Up Incremental Testing, as it had students create an artificially intelligent tic-tac-toe game by testing each feature as it was written instead of waiting until the whole program was written to test the outcomes.
  6) A6 had students compare two different builds of a calculator program from a Black-Box Testing perspective, using only the outcomes of the program on the command line to complete the analysis. 

CS351 - Algorithms:
  1) Each of this course's projects included various iterations of the 0-1 Knapsack problem with a Priority Queue template as the base. A1 was the Greedy Knapsack.
  2) A2 was the Dynamic Programming version.
  3) A3 was the Backtracking version.
  4) A4 was the Branch and Bound version.

SE461 - Managing Software Development:
  1) As a bit of an extension to CS341 and SE361, this class serves as a capstone in C++ development with more focus on software engineering techniques than before. For A1, I was tasked with creating an Array class from scratch.
  2) A2 built upon A1 by utilizing a lot of the same code the original Array class, but ensuring further safeties and abstraction through adding Stack and Queue template class features based upon the original Array class.
  3) For A3, I was tasked with creating a Calculator (or "Expression Evaluator") from scratch using Software Development patterns such as Abstract Factory and Command.
  4) A4 included developing the same functionality as A3, but with patterns Composite, Visitor, and Builder (with a tree structure) instead.
