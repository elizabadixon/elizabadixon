This repository includes the projects I have completed as part of my coursework as a Software Engineering student at Butler University:

For Advanced Data Structures course using C++:
  1) Indy500 Race Simulation (Intro to C++ classes).
  2) Shuffling within a card game simulation (Class Hierarchy, pointers, basic game logic/backend UI w/ pointers).
  3) Bit Display (Work with bit vectors, bit arrays, bit dictionaries, lookup tables).
  4) Doubly Linked List Traversal/Insertion.
  5) Red-Black Tree (insertions, rotations, traversal simulations, general red-black tree/binary tree rule implementation).
  6) Hash Table/Collision Technique Implementation (Chaining - includes removal of nodes in a linked list, cuckoo hashing, and linear/quadratic probing techniques).

For Computer Networks using C/C++:
  1) Basic socket object and connection connection.
  2) HTTP Message Object used to make an HTTP request.
  3) SMTP Mailer Agent that simulates an email being sent
  4) IP Calculator that accepts a CIDR format and displays the Network, Broadcast, and # of usable addresses.
