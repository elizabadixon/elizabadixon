This repository includes the projects I have completed as part of my coursework as a Software Engineering student at Butler University:

For Advanced Data Structures course using C++:
  1) Indy500 Race Simulation (Intro to C++ classes)
  2) Shuffling within a card game simulation (Class Hierarchy, pointers, basic game logic/backend UI w/ pointers)
  3) Bit Display (Work with bit vectors, bit arrays, bit dictionaries, lookup tables)
  4) Doubly Linked List Traversal/Insertion
  5) Red-Black Tree (insertions, rotations, traversal simulations, general red-black tree/binary tree rule implementation)
  6) Hash Table/Collision Technique Implementation (Chaining - includes removal of nodes in a linked list, cuckoo hashing, and linear/quadratic probing techniques)

For Computer Networks using C/C++:
  1) Basic socket connection
  2) HTTP Message Object
  3) SMTP Mailer
