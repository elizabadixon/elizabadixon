This is my GitHub account to display the projects I have accomplished!

For Advanced Data Structures course using C++:
  1) Indy500 Race Simulation (Intro to C++ classes)
  2) Basics of Game of War Card Game Simulation (Class hierarchy work)
  3) Bit Display (Work with bit vectors, bit arrays, bit dictionaries, lookup tables)
  4) Doubly Linked List Traversal/Insertion
  5) Red-Black Tree (insertions, rotations, different types of traversal simulations, general rule implementation)
  6) Hash Table/Collision Technique Implementation (Chaining - now includes removal of nodes in a linked list, cuckoo hashing, and linear/quadratic probing techniques)

For CS435 - Computer Netoworks (C++):
  1) Class in progress -->
  2) Have created a socket object that can be used to send a message to a mail developer (by utilizing SMTP)
